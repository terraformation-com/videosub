1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I would say the climate change is like my calling

2
00:05:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
What i really  like is that it is a natural solution

3
00:09:05,400 --> 00:12:59,400
We're taking the carbon  that's in the atmosphere,

4
00:12:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600
bring it back into the ground and into biomass

5
00:15:59,800 --> 00:17:59,800
and therefore reducing the level

6
00:18:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
of carbon dioxide  in the atmosphere

7
00:20:01,200 --> 00:21:55,200
and through that addressing  climate change

8
00:21:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
and hopefully  reduce the impact it will have.

9
00:26:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
At Terraformation, we are also addressing other issues like 

10
00:29:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
the lose of biodiversity by actual creating

11
00:32:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
native habitats with the trees or plants we plant.

12
00:36:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
So we can address multiple issues with that approach

13
00:39:01,400 --> 00:41:55,400
and that's really, really great

14
00:41:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
We need that to happen, it's time.
