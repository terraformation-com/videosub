1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The world can seem

2
00:03:04,200 --> 00:04:59,100
like  a kind  of  a  harrowing place right now

3
00:04:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
but to actually be  a part of the solution

4
00:09:01,499 --> 00:13:01,500
to global climate change is just very gratifying

5
00:18:01,700 --> 00:19:55,899
i'm at home in the forest

6
00:19:57,900 --> 00:22:03,900
and just want to make sure that my children

7
00:23:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
and future generations have that same exprience

8
00:25:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
So, that's why we're here collecting the seed

9
00:29:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
and planting the plants and do the work

10
00:31:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
so they can have that same experience. 

11
00:36:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Terraformation have came up with a plan 

12
00:39:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
and they're involving other people as well.

13
00:42:11,300 --> 00:46:12,300
And so it's going to be the growing phenomeno

14
00:47:12,500 --> 00:51:17,000
that with a lot of help, it just  can be  attainable

15
00:52:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
It just  give me hope that  we're doing the right thing

16
00:55:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
and that climate change can be solved.
