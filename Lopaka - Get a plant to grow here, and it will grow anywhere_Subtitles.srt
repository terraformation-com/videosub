1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you can get a plant to grow out there

2
00:03:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
it will grow anywhere because this

3
00:04:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
is like the most deserty area  on the whole island

4
00:11:07,599 --> 00:13:07,600
if you look around, it really dry.

5
00:13:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
There is barely any water

6
00:15:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It rains here two, three times maybe, a year

7
00:20:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I belive that this place , at one time , did not look like this

8
00:23:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
And we could bring it back, bring the forest back.

9
00:26:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
I'd love to see all of these plants

10
00:28:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
that we put in the ground go off and turn into the forest

11
00:33:15,000 --> 00:34:16,100
It feels good.

12
00:35:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
And i tell  my kids all the time

13
00:36:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
that later on they're gonna get to see

14
00:38:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
a nice forest here and that I was a part

15
00:40:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
of putting this together.
