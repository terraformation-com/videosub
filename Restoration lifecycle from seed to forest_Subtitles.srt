1
00:03:07,528 --> 00:05:07,529
The effects of the climate change seen to be accelerating 

2
00:05:07,729 --> 00:06:08,729
at an exponential rate

3
00:09:08,929 --> 00:11:09,929
Plants aiming at solving some portion of the problem

4
00:11:11,128 --> 00:14:11,129
in 50 years , or like over next 100 years,

5
00:15:11,329 --> 00:17:12,329
are possible fatally too slow

6
00:19:12,529 --> 00:22:13,529
In order to fully decarbonize the grid

7
00:22:13,729 --> 00:26:59,729
and then remove all of the excess CO2 that's been released,

8
00:26:59,929 --> 00:29:59,929
we probably have to achieve that, in about 30 years

9
00:30:00,129 --> 00:32:01,129
And event that's kind of a dangerously long timeframe

10
00:32:01,329 --> 00:34:02,329
In order to have like 10 or 20 years of forest maturity,

11
00:35:02,529 --> 00:39:03,529
it means we have to do all the out planting in 10 years

12
00:39:04,728 --> 00:44:04,729
If the goal is to plant 1 trillion trees

13
00:44:04,929 --> 00:47:55,929
we need 2 trillion seeds

14
00:47:56,129 --> 00:50:57,129
So fist we go out into the field.

15
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:58,329
Once we have  the seed , we bring them back here to

16
00:53:00,000 --> 00:58:00,529
either the nursery or the seed bank will process the seed

17
00:58:00,729 --> 00:59:01,729
clean them up , get them ready to dry

18
01:00:02,928 --> 01:03:02,929
This is gonna allow people store the seeds

19
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,129
for future restoration sites

20
01:05:05,328 --> 01:09:05,329
So we bank some seeds and we plant some seeds

21
01:09:05,529 --> 01:11:06,529
So we bring them here into the nursery

22
01:11:06,729 --> 01:14:07,729
The greenhouse are exactly what you see here

23
01:14:07,929 --> 01:16:08,929
It's the same greenhouse that are gonna be shipped

24
01:16:09,129 --> 01:17:10,129
all over the world

25
01:17:10,329 --> 01:20:11,329
So it just gives people the tools to grow the plants

26
01:20:11,529 --> 01:22:12,529
We know it can be done here

27
01:22:12,729 --> 01:25:13,729
We're doing it successfully and they can do it too.

28
01:29:13,929 --> 01:31:14,929
We pick up the plant in the nursery 

29
01:31:15,129 --> 01:34:16,129
that preselected for that planting day.

30
01:34:16,329 --> 01:36:17,329
Each tree gets a little irrigation line

31
01:36:17,529 --> 01:39:18,529
and gets watered every second for a little bit

32
01:39:18,729 --> 01:41:19,729
to help it in the beginning

33
01:41:19,929 --> 01:44:20,929
give them nice little bit of soil, fertilizer 

34
01:44:21,129 --> 01:48:22,129
We're using diatomaceous earth to keep bugs

35
01:48:22,329 --> 01:49:23,329
from climbing on them

36
01:49:23,529 --> 01:51:24,529
After the  planting, we go through

37
01:51:24,729 --> 01:55:25,729
and take the geo location of each point

38
01:55:25,929 --> 01:59:26,929
And then the information get stored in the geo databases

39
01:59:27,129 --> 02:01:28,129
for the geographic information system.

40
02:01:28,329 --> 02:04:29,329
Eventually once they're all established 

41
02:04:29,529 --> 02:06:30,529
they'll support each other.

42
02:06:30,729 --> 02:07:31,729
They'll cool this area

43
02:07:31,929 --> 02:10:32,929
which will help the rain and moisture stay here

44
02:10:33,129 --> 02:14:34,129
And so we can turn this desert into a forest again.

45
02:15:34,329 --> 02:18:35,329
There's a lot involved that needs to happen

46
02:18:35,529 --> 02:19:36,529
to able to get these trees into the ground.

47
02:19:36,729 --> 02:24:37,729
And it's a lot of work, but  it's all worth it.

48
02:24:37,929 --> 02:26:38,929
It just, it feels good to be doing the work

49
02:26:39,129 --> 02:30:40,129
to be putting these practices in place

50
02:30:40,329 --> 02:36:41,329
and to be moving forward
