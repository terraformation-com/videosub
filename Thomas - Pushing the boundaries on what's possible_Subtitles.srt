1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the issues with climate,

2
00:03:04,200 --> 00:05:00,000
it's almost overwhelming problem

3
00:05:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
it can make you  wanna give up

4
00:08:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
and not do anything

5
00:09:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
but then, we realized like, oh,

6
00:11:04,799 --> 00:15:04,800
there are something we can do.

7
00:15:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
we can plant trees

8
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:30,200
we can help other people plant trees

9
00:16:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
we can find way to made it easier

10
00:18:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
for other people to plant trees

11
00:20:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
and we can improve our climate,

12
00:25:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
as well as the world's climate.

13
00:30:36,199 --> 00:32:36,200
it's really amazing  to be part of project

14
00:32:36,400 --> 00:33:37,599
that's try to  push the boundaries of what's possible

15
00:33:37,799 --> 00:37:38,799
and that's what  keeps me going

16
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:39,999
